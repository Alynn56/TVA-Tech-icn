# TVA Technology
An addon for Garry's Mod that adds technology from the Loki Television series.

## Features

### Time Doors
The main feature of this addon are Time Doors. These glassy rectangles can transport you anywhere you desire.

### Tempad
The Tempad is a device with the primary purpose of opening and closing linked Time Door pairs.
It has a menu where you can select a player or waypoint to travel to, customise the time door, or create a new waypoint.
At the bottom is a button to open a pair of Time Doors, with the entrance appearing at your crosshair.

## COMING SOON

### Wiremod support
The standalone Time Door entity will be made to support wiremod inputs and outputs, letting you use them in your contraptions and dupes with style.

### Time Stick
This futuristic weapon is designed to violently rip your enemy from every thread of time and space, basically desintegrating them.

### Reset Charge
A similar technology to the time stick, but it instead wipes out an entire timeline. (Or in this case, everything in the map.)
